NSA Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is an implementation of
fine-grained and flexible nondiscretionary access controls in the
Linux kernel <citation><XRef LinkEnd="LoscoccoFreenix01"></citation>.
The SELinux implementation has been reworked by NAI Labs to use the
Linux Security Modules (LSM) kernel patch<citation><XRef
LinkEnd="SmalleyModuleTR01"></citation>.  This technical report
describes the functional test suite developed for the LSM-based
SELinux security module.  
</para>

<para>
The test suite permits automated validation of the correct
implementation of the SELinux access controls in the hook functions of
the LSM-based SELinux security module.  The test suite does not yet
provide comprehensive coverage of all of the SELinux hook functions.
Nonetheless, the test suite can be used to provide feedback on the
basic functionality of the SELinux module as the module is undergoing
continued development.  The test suite does not provide any validation
of the example security policy configuration or system security; such
validation is outside the scope of this test suite.
</para>

<para>
The report begins by providing an overview of the test environment,
including a discussion of the test policy configuration and test
scripts.  It then briefly describes each set of tests, identifying the
set of access controls that are being tested.  Finally, the report
summarizes the current test coverage.
